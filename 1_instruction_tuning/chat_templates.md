# Chat Templates

Chat templates are essential for structuring interactions between users and AI models. They ensure that the model's responses are consistent and contextually appropriate.

## Conversational Format

The conversational format in chat templates is designed to facilitate natural dialogue. Key components include:

- **System Prompts**: Initial instructions or context provided to the model to guide its responses.
- **Role-based Messages**: Specifies roles such as "user" and "assistant," helping the model understand who is speaking and tailor its responses accordingly.
- **Dialogue History**: Maintains a history of previous interactions to provide context and continuity in the conversation.

This format is particularly effective in applications like customer support and personal assistants, where maintaining a coherent and engaging dialogue is crucial.

## Instruction Format

The instruction format in chat templates focuses on providing clear and actionable tasks for the model. It includes:

- **Explicit Instructions**: Detailed guidelines that outline the task the model needs to perform.
- **Structured Outputs**: Templates or examples of the expected output, ensuring the model understands the task requirements.

This format is useful in scenarios where the model needs to execute specific tasks, such as generating reports or answering factual questions.

## Implementing Chat Templates

Models like those using the `ctransformers` library can apply chat templates using methods like `apply_chat_template`. This method formats the input messages according to the defined template, ensuring that the model's output aligns with the expected conversational structure.

### Steps to Implement Chat Templates

1. **Define the Template**: Create a template that includes system prompts, role-based messages, and any necessary dialogue history.
2. **Apply the Template**: Use the `apply_chat_template` method to format the input messages. This ensures that the model receives the input in a structured format.
3. **Generate Responses**: Once the template is applied, the model can generate responses that are consistent with the defined conversational or instructional format.

## Benefits of Using Chat Templates

- **Consistency**: Ensures uniformity in responses, making interactions predictable and reliable.
- **Contextual Relevance**: Maintains the context of the conversation, improving user experience by providing relevant and timely responses.
- **Flexibility**: Allows customization to suit specific applications or user interactions, making it adaptable to various use cases.

## Advanced Features

- **Dynamic Templates**: Incorporate dynamic elements that adjust based on user input or context, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the conversation.
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Support for multi-turn dialogues where the model can maintain context over several interactions, crucial for complex conversational tasks.
