## Introduction

Instruction tuning involves adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks by further training them on task-specific datasets. This process helps models improve their performance on targeted tasks.

## Data Structures

Understanding the data structures used in instruction tuning is crucial. Two primary formats guide model interactions:

- **Instruction Format**: Provides explicit tasks for the model to perform.
- **Conversational Format**: Structures interactions as a dialogue between a user and a system.

## Chat Templates

Chat templates structure interactions between users and AI models, ensuring consistent and contextually appropriate responses. They include components like system prompts and role-based messages.

For more detailed information, refer to the [Chat Templates](./chat_templates.md) section.

## Supervised Fine-Tuning

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a critical process for adapting pre-trained language models to specific tasks. It involves training the model on a task-specific dataset with labeled examples.

For a detailed guide on SFT, including key steps and best practices, see the [Supervised Fine-Tuning](./supervised_fine_tuning.md) page.

## Conclusion

Supervised fine-tuning is a powerful technique for adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks. By understanding the key concepts and data structures, you can effectively implement this process and improve model performance.
