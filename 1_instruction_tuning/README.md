# Instruction Tuning

This tutorial provides a concise guide on instruction tuning of language models, focusing on the key concepts and steps involved in the process.

Instruction tuning involves adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks by further training them on task-specific datasets. This process helps models improve their performance on targeted tasks. Instruction tuning uses two primary formats to guide model interactions:

- **Instruction Format**: Provides explicit tasks for the model to perform.
- **Conversational Format**: Structures interactions as a dialogue between a user and a system.

## Chat Templates

Chat templates structure interactions between users and AI models, ensuring consistent and contextually appropriate responses. They include components like system prompts and role-based messages.

For more detailed information, refer to the [Chat Templates](./chat_templates.md) section.

## Supervised Fine-Tuning

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is a critical process for adapting pre-trained language models to specific tasks. It involves training the model on a task-specific dataset with labeled examples.

For a detailed guide on SFT, including key steps and best practices, see the [Supervised Fine-Tuning](./supervised_fine_tuning.md) page.
